        <h2>So, can a single biometric predict an exam grade? Or was it too good to be true?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>What does "r" mean?</b> "r" (correlation coefficient) measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.</li>
            <li><b>Positive correlation (r > 0):</b> Higher biometric values are associated with higher exam scores (e.g., if r = 0.5, students with higher biometrics tend to score higher).</li>
            <li><b>Negative correlation (r < 0):</b> Higher biometric values are associated with lower exam scores (e.g., if r = -0.5, students with higher biometrics tend to score lower).</li>
            <li><b>Strength of correlation:</b> An r value close to 1 or -1 means a stronger relationship, while r near 0 means almost no relationship.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>No single biometric measure strongly correlates with exam performance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The strongest correlation was only <b>0.60</b> (moderate).</li>
            <li>Most correlations were weak, close to <b>0</b>.</li>
            <li>Different biometrics showed different patterns across exams.</li>
            <li>Factors like study habits, stress, and prior knowledge also play a role.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Turns out, success isn't as simple as checking your pulse before an exam!</p>

        <h2>Writeup</h2>
        <h3>Motivation and Target Audience:</h3> 
        <p>Our project explores the notion that a single biometric grade can predict an exam grade. We wanted the users to explore the data and evaluate the validity of the proposed hypothesis themselves. This visualization can be particularly useful for students, educators, and researchers that are interested in understanding the potential relationship between biometric measures and exam grades. For example, students can use this to reflect on whether a specific biometric measure would have an impact on exam grades. A key question this visualization helps to answer is: can a single biometric measure determine an exam grade? Users can analyze this by exploring the possible combinations of different exams and biometrics we have and observing the trends.</p>
        <h3>Design Rationale:</h3>
        <p>We chose a scatter plot because it effectively displays correlations between two continuous variables, exam grades and biometric measures.We initially considered creating three scatter plots with all five biometrics plotted against different exam scores, with the three different exams - Midterm 1, Midterm 2, Final -  as the dropdown, but we ultimately decided against it. This approach would make each scatter plot too cluttered, making it difficult for the viewer to see each biometric’s correlation with the exam scores. Instead, we chose a single scatter plot and users could select a specific biometric and exam combination using drop-down lists. When it comes to processing the data, out of the six biometrics in our dataset, we chose to only use five, excluding the ACC, because the ACC data format didn’t seem viable for our visualization, as it would require a different type of plot, making it more complex than we want especially since we want students to use it not just experts. Since the original dataset was separated into multiple folders and files, we decided to combine it all into a single CSV, by manually input the exam grades, calculating the average of the five biometrics for each student for all students in the dataset. Then combining it all into a CSV file that we used for the rest of our project.</p>
        <p>We built a button that enables users to explore our narrative in a sequential manner. Upon clicking it, the user is guided to the next page, allowing them to progress through the story as they learn more about the relationship between biometrics and student grades. In addition to the button, we decided on a few different interactive components to our project: a tool tip, two dropdown menus, and a button to let the user navigate to different phases of the website.</p>
        <p>We incorporated a tooltip to enhance the viewer's understanding of the data by displaying the exact biometric value and student exam score when the viewer hovers over a data point. Since we calculated the average of a student’s biometric measurements to use as data points, the plotted points could be too dispersed to clearly show the general trend, so we added a trendline to help the user better visualize the correlation between the biometrics and exam scores.</p>
        <p>In addition, we included a panel to the right of the plot which portrays the Pearson correlation for all the possible biometric-grade combinations in descending order. As the user selects a specific combination using the dropdown menus, the circle icon corresponding to that combination on the panel is highlighted, so as to make comparisons between the current selection and others more straightforward. Furthermore, every time a user makes a selection, the scatter plot’s axes and corresponding axis labels change to reflect the new selection.</p>
        <p>For color choices, we used steel blue for the scatter plot points to maintain neutral tone while ensuring the points are distinguishable from the white background. Also, the selected exam-biometric combination in the correlation panel is highlighted in blue to draw the user’s attention to their current choice. This color choice was done to enhance readability without overwhelming the visualization.</p>
        <h3>Further Improvements:</h3>
        <p>While our visualization effectively communicates key findings to our question, some improvements could enhance the experience even further. For example, incorporating a larger dataset would help improve the generalizability of our data. For example, having more students in the dataset or additional biometric measures.</p>
        <h3>Communication:</h3>
        <p>We had frequent Zoom meetings, as well as continuous communication using our group chat. In our first couple of meetings, we went over ideas we had for the final project and brainstormed different plots that represented the relationship between the variables in our Physionet dataset. After we submitted the checkpoint, we made a rough pen-and-paper sketch of how we wanted our final site to look. We worked asynchronously on personal repos to develop the first drafts of our project, and kept each other informed of our progress.</p>
        <h3>Data Processing:</h3>
        <p>Our dataset was rather large, so preprocessing took us time. We extracted the grades through a manually defined dictionary, and wrote a function to read the CSV file, process the data, and compute the average value for each biometric measure. We stored all extracted and computed data in a structured dictionary, which was later converted to a DataFrame. We utilized this data to build a scatter plot that reflected the relationship between the biometric feature and exam grade combination the user inputted. We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient for the trendline as well.</p>
        <h3>Time Spent:</h3>
        <p>Building the drop down menus, and syncing the options selected by the user to reflect changes in the scatter plot took the most amount of time. For our project, it was crucial to understand how our biometric features were collected and calculated, and what they represented. We spent time analyzing this to ensure our transformations were meaningful. In total, we spent about 10 hours per person developing the different aspects of the webpage. </p>
